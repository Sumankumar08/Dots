            <p id=info>Everyone as a child would have definitely played this game in school. The game is very simple. <br>
            <br>
            Connect the dots to make a box. The player gets a turn to connect two dots. And the next turn would be played by the next player. Once the square is complete you get that box as 1 point. This game is a 6x6 grid. Once the whole grid is complete the player with the highest number of boxes wins.<br>
            <br>
            No diagonal lines are allowed in the game. Only 1 chance per turn. <br> 
            <br>
            Have fun and enjoy the game!!
